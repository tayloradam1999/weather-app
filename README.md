# weather-app

A React-Typescript application that allows users to enter any city name and get the current weather.

I built this web app as I have been going through *Holberton School's Full-Stack Web Dev Curriculum*, and while learning ```React```, I felt
it might be a good idea to make an application with ```React``` and ```Typescript``` in conjunction with one another, as we don't have many projects
dealing with ```Typescript```.
